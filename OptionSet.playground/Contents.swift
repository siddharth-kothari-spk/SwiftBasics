/*
 We use OptionSet to represent and work in a type-safe way with a group of related members (or options). Its concept is similar to the enum, but it has some quite useful features that are not available in mere enumerations.
 
 Say weâ€™re developing a project management tool and want to have tasks of different importance and difficulty. The standard way to do this is with an enumeration:
 */

enum TaskType {
    case urgent
    case notUrgent
    case easy
    case hard
}

struct Task {
    let title: String
    let taskType: TaskType
    
    init(title: String, taskType: TaskType) {
        self.title = title
        self.taskType = taskType
    }
}

let task = Task(title: "Not urgent task", taskType: .notUrgent)

// But what if we want our Item to be both not urgent and easy? We have to make the taskType property an array and change its signature to taskTypes:

struct TaskMultiple {
    let title: String
    let taskTypes: [TaskType]
    
    init(title: String, taskTypes: [TaskType]) {
        self.title = title
        self.taskTypes = taskTypes
    }
}

let taskMultiple = TaskMultiple(title: "Not urgent and easy task", taskTypes: [.notUrgent, .easy])
