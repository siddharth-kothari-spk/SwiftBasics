/*
 how to write code according to the SOLID principles without using protocols and without losing abstraction.

 The Structure Oriented Programming is a paradigm based on the fact that any protocol can be replaced by a structure.

 The advantages of this approach is performance.
 Since the structure-oriented approach is based on structures that use static dispatch, the dispatch speed will be significantly different from protocols with dynamic dispatch in the protocol-oriented approach.
