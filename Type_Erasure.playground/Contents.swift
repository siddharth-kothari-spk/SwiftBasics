/*
 When working with protocols and generics in Swift, you may encounter situations where you need to hide the specific type information of an object and provide a more generic interface. This is where type erasure comes into play
 
 Type erasure is a powerful technique in Swift that allows you to conceal the specific type information of an object, presenting a more generic interface to the outside world.
 
 In Swift, type erasure is typically achieved using the Any or AnyObject types.

     Any can hold a reference to any type
     AnyObject can hold a reference to any class type.

 By utilizing these types, you can erase the specific type information and interact with objects through a generic interface.

 Another technique to erase types is to create a concrete wrapper type (such as AnyPublisher), which hide away the details of the generic types.

 Now, letâ€™s say we want to work with a collection of animals without exposing their specific types. This is where type erasure comes in handy. We can create a type eraser struct called AnyAnimal that conforms to the Animal protocol

 Inside AnyAnimal, we have private properties _name and _makeSound of function types that capture the name and makeSound() implementations of the underlying animal. The init method takes a generic parameter T that conforms to the Animal protocol and initializes the private properties with the corresponding implementations.
