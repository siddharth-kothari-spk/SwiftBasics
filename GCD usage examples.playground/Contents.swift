 Key Features of GCD

     Queues: GCD uses queues to manage tasks. There are two types of queues: serial and concurrent. Serial queues execute tasks one after the other, while concurrent queues can execute multiple tasks simultaneously.
     Dispatch Groups: Dispatch groups enable synchronization of multiple tasks. You can use them to wait for a group of tasks to complete before executing further code.
     Dispatch Semaphores: Semaphores provide a mechanism to control access to shared resources. They can be used to ensure that a limited number of tasks access a particular resource at a time.
     Dispatch Sources: Dispatch sources enable monitoring of system events like file changes, timers, signals, and more.

// A News Aggregator App

// 1. Fetching Articles Concurrently :
//Fetching articles from multiple sources can be time-consuming if done serially. With GCD, we can create a concurrent queue and fetch articles from different sources simultaneously.

let concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.articleFetching", attributes: .concurrent)

sources.forEach { source in
    concurrentQueue.async {
        let articles = fetchArticles(from: source)
        processAndDisplay(articles)
    }
}

// 2. Synchronizing Article Processing

//When processing articles, it’s essential to ensure that they’re displayed correctly and without any race conditions. To achieve this, we can use a dispatch group to synchronize the processing of articles.

let dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup()

sources.forEach { source in
    concurrentQueue.async(group: dispatchGroup) {
        let articles = fetchArticles(from: source)
        dispatchGroup.enter()
        processAndDisplay(articles)
        dispatchGroup.leave()
    }
}

dispatchGroup.notify(queue: .main) {
    print("All articles processed and displayed.")
}

// 3. Limiting Concurrent Network Requests

//To prevent overwhelming the network with too many concurrent requests, we can use a dispatch semaphore to limit the number of simultaneous requests.

let networkSemaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 3)

sources.forEach { source in
    networkSemaphore.wait()
    concurrentQueue.async {
        let articles = fetchArticles(from: source)
        processAndDisplay(articles)
        networkSemaphore.signal()
    }
}

// 4. Monitoring System Events

//In the news aggregator app, we can use dispatch sources to monitor and respond to system events. For example, we can watch for network connectivity changes to update the app’s behavior accordingly.

let networkReachabilitySource = DispatchSource.makeNetworkReachabilitySource(flags: .reachable, queue: .main)
networkReachabilitySource.setEventHandler {
    if networkReachabilitySource.flags.contains(.reachable) {
        print("Network is reachable. Resume fetching articles.")
    } else {
        print("Network is unreachable. Pause fetching articles.")
    }
}
networkReachabilitySource.resume()

// 5. Implementing Timers

//Using dispatch sources, we can also implement timers to refresh the app’s content at regular intervals. This ensures that users always have access to the latest news articles.

let refreshInterval: TimeInterval = 60 * 5 // 5 minutes
let refreshTimer = DispatchSource.makeTimerSource(queue: .main)
refreshTimer.schedule(deadline: .now() + refreshInterval, repeating: refreshInterval)

refreshTimer.setEventHandler {
    print("5 minutes have passed. Refreshing articles...")
    fetchAndProcessArticles()
}

refreshTimer.resume()
