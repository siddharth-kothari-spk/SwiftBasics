// Async streams allow you to replace existing code that is based on closures or Combine publishers.
// AsyncThrowingStream as a stream of elements that could potentially result in a thrown error. Values deliver over time, and the stream can be closed by a finish event. A finish event could either be a success or a failure once an error occurs.
// An AsyncStream is similar to the throwing variant but will never result in a throwing error
// An AsyncThrowingStream can be an excellent replacement for existing code based upon closures like progress and completion handlers
